**Thoughts** 

My opinion hasn't changed - JS/PHP > Ruby :)))

### Day 4: May 26, Monday

**Today's Progress**:

Learned about React's secondary callback, mapping arrays and key attribute importance. Refreshed my knowledge about promises. Also, learned about StrictMode which is very useful to detect any side effects.
