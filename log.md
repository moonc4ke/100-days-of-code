# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 18, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:

React: started learning React again. Just refreshing basics. Picked up the ZTM course.

Rails: struggling with current project to understand on how to introduce a new polymorphic association to an existing model ;( it works but not the way I want :D 

**Thoughts** 

Maybe because of my background but right now my oppinion is like this - JS/PHP > Ruby :D
